    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I worked out how to access my blog template after trying a few different options. This meant that I could still continue through what we had to do in the lesson, while learning how to do it. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Whenever something I did didn't work, I would question myself; what has gone wrong, and how can I fix it? This has meant that I get more things correct quickly by continuing to question myself until the problem is resolved.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked by myself, and didn’t have someone telling me what to do. As a result, I learned how to access copies of this template and upload blog posts to my Github website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on my learning from before half term, and realised that the times that I did especially well were the times that I didn’t ask for help from others.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged well in this lesson, and listened to all of the instructions that were given to us. As a result, I didn’t need to ask any silly questions, because I tried to understand all parts of the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could maybe have got around to actually doing the tasks set quicker, instead of not focussing and making silly mistakes like typing my password wrong. I could also have just got around trying to do the tasks, instead of wondering how to do them.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could focus at all times so that I don’t make errors that shouldn’t happen, like typing my password wrong at the beginning of the lesson. I could also have got straight around to the tasks, instead of spending a minute or two simply thinking about how that I could get straight around to doing the tasks. If I correct these simple errors, I will be able to finish tasks and start new ones much quicker. </td>
