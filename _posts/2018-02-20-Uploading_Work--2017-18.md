    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>When I was trying to work out what was wrong, I questioned myself every time that it went wrong until it eventually worked.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I found the solution to the problem by myself, and didn't have to get help from anyone.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on the targets that I set myself before half term, and tried to achieve them by the end of the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged very well with the lesson and quickly finished uploading my documents - I then managed to achieve both targets.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could maybe have set myself more targets to achieve, as I completed both of them very swiftly. This wasnâ€™t really a bad thing as I have begun to make my game more decorative, but it would have been better if I had had more targets to achieve.</td>
