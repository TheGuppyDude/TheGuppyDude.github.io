  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Whenever I failed to complete a level, I would keep trying different solutions that I thought would work until I found a solution that completed the level.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned myself whenever I failed a level - what went wrong? I kept doing this until I found a solution that worked.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I solved all of the levels by myself, without asking anyone else for help. This helped me to understand why the solution was right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on previous mistakes that I made, and fixed the current code that I had up according to what went wrong in previous attempts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged well with the lesson, and almost completed the main task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could maybe have thought about what code I was going to use before I put it in, rather than just throwing code in and hoping that it worked - which got me nowhere in the lesson.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to think about the code that I am utilising and if it will complete the level, instead of just guessing what code would solve the problem.</td>
