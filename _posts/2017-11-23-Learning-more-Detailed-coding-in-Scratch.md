  <tr>
    <td> Starting point:</td>
    <td>To learn more detailed code in Scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To begin coding Space Invaders on Scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I feel that I reached my target, as my Scratch version of Space Invaders is coming along nicely, and has a few different components.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered well in this lesson, as I would try to fix anything that didn't work by myself. This helped me learn the more difficult lines of code more quickly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I would question myself when the work was very hard, as I was occasionally tempted to ask someone else how to do the work. But, by asking myself why I was going to ask other people for help, I worked it out in the end.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I independently worked out the solutions to the problems that I faced in the lesson. This helped my persevering, and other learning habits, too.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on lessons where I had been unable to do something, and decided to just focus on that lesson, instead of worrying about things like how much homework I had that day.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged well with the lesson, and tried to ignore any disturbances to me in the lesson - like people asking me how to solve problems, which would prevent them learning how to get around problems in lessons.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have tried to ignore people asking for help a bit more. I don’t want to do this, as this prevents said person from persevering, and not using some of their learning habits in the lesson.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I can make a massive effort to decline pleas for help from people who can’t do the task set. This would make me work quicker, as I wouldn’t have to stop and decline people so often. I would also be able to focus on the work more easily.</td>
