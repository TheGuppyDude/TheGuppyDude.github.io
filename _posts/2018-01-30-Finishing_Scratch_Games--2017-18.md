    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered by trying many different options when a part of programming went wrong. </td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Whenever I decided to add something new into my game, I would question myself on whether it would be possible for me to code it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I did everything in my game by myself, without any help from anyone else. This meant that I know how to do everything by myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on previous lessons, and tried to focus mostly on the areas of coding that I found difficult, so that I would find them easier in the future.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged well with the lesson, and was one of the only people to finish their game.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

    <td>I could maybe have worked a bit slower, and tried not to rush. This is because I finished my game 10 minutes before the end of the lesson.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
