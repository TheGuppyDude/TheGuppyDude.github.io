    <td>Persevering</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Whenever I thought of a new target, I would question whether it would be a good target to try and achieve.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I assessed other peoples' games on my own, so that I could assess them correctly.</td>

    <td>I reflected back on the improvements that people had given me, and decided which ones were good targets to try and achieve.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged well with the lesson, and I completed the task of evaluating your game quickly, with lots of time to spare.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>

    <td>I could maybe have done more targets for myself, as the two that I have set myself won’t take me to long to code.</td>
