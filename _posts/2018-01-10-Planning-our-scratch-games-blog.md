    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>To plan a game to make on Scratch.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete a game plan of our game.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, but it was completed as homework.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When I couldn't think of an idea for a game, I persevered by thinking of multiple options that I liked until I came up with an idea that would be both fun to code and fun to play. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Whenever I came up with a new idea for a game, I questioned myself whether it would be possible for me to code by myself. I continued questioning until I found a suitable idea.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I thought of my game idea independently, and came up with all of the little details by myself. I didn't have to ask anyone for game ideas, which helped me be independent.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on previous lessons in which we have done Scratch, and thought what aspects of Scratch I find difficult. I didnâ€™t include many of these, so that my game would be suitable to code for someone at my level.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged well with the lesson, and produced a well-structured plan. Engaging with the lesson allowed me to focus more on my own work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could maybe have thought of an idea for my game a bit quicker, as I spent around 5 minutes just thinking about what game I should do. This wasted time that I could have spent planning.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could try to make decisions quicker, as then I would be able to spend more time on the actual task. This would prevent me spending loads of time on decisions that I need to make, and would get me on to the main task quicker.</td>
