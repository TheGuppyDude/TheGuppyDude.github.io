    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I spent most of the lesson trying the same question over and over again. I tried many different ways of completing the puzzle, and eventually got very close to solving it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned the code that I had just used when the attempt didn't work, and would change the part that I thought wasn’t working as I wanted it to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I attempted the puzzle independently, and didn’t ask for help, as I wanted to be able to say that I completed the puzzle by myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on previous attempts to work out what needed fixing on the code that I was using at that moment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged well with the lesson, and got on to the hardest question very quickly, because I had focused on the lesson brief.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could maybe have tried not to get distracted by other people cheering because they had completed the question which I got stuck on.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to not get distracted by other people’s success, as I could possibly have found a solution to the problem if I wasn’t getting distracted by other people completing the question.</td>
    <td></td>
