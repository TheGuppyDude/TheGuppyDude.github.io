       **    Retro Games and their sprites and variables**

Donkey Kong

Sprites: Donkey kong himself, the princess that he has captured, the barrels that he throws at you (there are two types, the blue barrel that he throws at the start, and the regular orange ones.) Also, the oil drum in the bottom right corner, the fireball with eyes that follows you and, finally, Mario, who is who you play as. Also, the entire thing that you stand and run on is one giant sprite. As well as these, the orange gorilla that appears when you die is a sprite.

Variables: Your score (which is the number of zeros in the top left), the level number (in the top right), your lives (which are the little men in the top left), the high score, and the bonus in the top right.

                                   

    Space Invaders

Sprites: The red spaceships, the numbers that flash up when you hit a red enemy spaceship, the popping image that flashes up when you hit a regular spaceship, and the bullet that you fire are all sprites. So are the green shields, and the spaceship that you play as.

Variables: The names on the leaderboard, your score and the amount of lives that you have are all variables in this game. Also, your name is technically a variable as you can change it when you wish.

Pac-man

Sprites: The 4 ghosts, Pac man, the little dots that you eat and the blue board are all sprites. So are the words 'game over' that flash up every time that you die.

Variables: Your score, and your lives are the only variables in this game.

Pong

Sprites: The two white paddles and the square ball are some of the sprites in this game. So is the dotted line in the middle of the screen, and the words that flash up on the screen whenever someone wins the game.

Variables: The game score, and the high scores are the only variables in the game.

Asteroids

Sprites: The spaceship that you play as, and all the enemy spaceships are all sprites. So are the three different types of asteroid that you hit, and the bullets that you fire. Also, the words 'game over' and ‘new game’ are sprites too.

Variables: Your score, and the amount of lives that you have are variables in this game. Also, your name is a variable as you can change it when you wish, and the high scores are also variables.
