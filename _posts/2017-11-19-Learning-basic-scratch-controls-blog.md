  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Whenever I made a mistake in the lesson, I tried numerous different options until the error in my code was fixed. This meant that I could learn from any mistakes that I made.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Every time something went wrong in the lesson, I asked myself what went wrong, and tried a new option. I kept at this until I had achieved the task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I achieved the targets of this lesson on my own, and as a result, learnt everything quicker than if I had been taught how to do the tasks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on previous mistakes in lessons, and realised that if you want a task doing well, you have to do it yourself. This helped improve all of my learning habits this week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged well in this lesson, and did not have to ask anyone how to do any of the tasks. This also helped my independence in the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have tried to do the tasks a little bit quicker, so that I could be among the first to complete the tasks. This would enable me to learn quicker, and get me to practise being more efficient.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to improve my efficiency in my work, and then I can learn quicker, and get the tasks done well. I will try even harder to work at my maximum efficiency level, and then I will be one of the first people to have finished the first task and be ready for the next one. </td>
