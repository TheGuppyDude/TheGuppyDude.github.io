    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>To begin the coding process of our Scratch games.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have gathered all our sprites, and to have picked a backdrop. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, but it was completed as homework.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered by trying many different solutions when I couldn't find a suitable sprite. I kept this up, and eventually selected a sprite suitable for its part in the game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Whenever I found a new sprite, I would question whether it would be a good choice of sprite. If it was a bad choice, I wouldn’t use that sprite.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I picked all the sprites on my own, and coded all of them by myself. This way, I can learn the code faster.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on what took me ages to code in previous lessons, and tried to do these areas more quickly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged well with the lesson, and therefore didn’t need to ask any silly questions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have worked slightly quicker, as I needed to finish the class work for homework.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work a tiny bit faster in lessons, so that I can get all of the class work done on time and not finished as homework.</td>
